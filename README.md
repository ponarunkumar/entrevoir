## Inspiration
As a recruiter, once the applicant(s) are screened and ready for the interview with hiring managers, there is a considerable time delay to get the interview schedules from the respective hiring team due to their day to day activities and other internal business priorities. Mostly due to the time availability of the hiring manager as they find it difficult to run through pages of resume content of multiple candidates. Hence, Entrevoir - helps the recruiter to dispatch a link to the hiring team such that the hiring manager and the interviewer team could listen to the key highlights of candidate(s) even when they're on the move (driving, running, exercising, walking, etc.,)

What it does?
Entrevoir transforms traditional hiring practices by enabling the recruiting and hiring team to listen to the key highlights from the applicant, candidate resumes over seamless integration of voice technology.
